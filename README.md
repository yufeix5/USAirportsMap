# USAirportsMap

This is a web map of all of the airports located in the United States. Each airport is indicated to have a control tower or not. We use two primary data sets for this map, the us-states.geojson data file which includes States shapefile as well as the count number of airports in each State (by Mike Bostock of D3). The data for airports, location, and control tower information stored in airports.geojson from data.gov. This map is interactive. Each airport has a plane icon stylized by applying font awesome. The color green indicates that there is a control tower, whereas black/gray indicates the absence of a control tower. This is also a choropleth map that the color scheme was applied to show the airports density in each state: the darker color means a higher density of airports. Also, when clicking the plain icon, airports' names will be shown accordingly. Besides the zoom in or out option, the map also includes a button to let you enter and quit fullscreen mode.
